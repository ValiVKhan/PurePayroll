To deploy code to Heroku, you first need to just update GitHub.

To updated GitHub go to source control icon and make comment in Message area then click on check mark to commit.

Once changes are committed (the check mark you checked), then go to '...' and Push. This will push to GitHub and then subsequently publish on Heroku.
